# PROJECT CONSTITUTION  
## A Place to Put a Thought You Don’t Need to Keep Carrying

---

## 1. PROJECT ESSENCE

This project is a human-centered digital experience designed to help people temporarily offload a single thought they are carrying, without analysis, judgment, permanence, or obligation.

It is not designed to solve problems, improve outcomes, generate insight, or encourage continued engagement.

Its purpose is relief — brief, reversible, and available at the moment it is needed.

This project prioritizes restraint, safety, dignity, and respect for emotional autonomy.

---

## 2. CORE PURPOSE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The project exists to make emotional offloading available:
- immediately
- privately
- safely
- without preparation
- without explanation
- without consequence

It is designed for moments when a person:
- is overwhelmed, tired, or numb
- does not want advice
- does not want to be analyzed
- does not want to perform vulnerability
- does not want to commit to a process

The experience must always feel optional, interruptible, and complete even if abandoned halfway.

---

## 3. WHAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT

This project is explicitly NOT:
- Therapy
- Journaling
- Mental health treatment
- Coaching
- Advice-giving
- Social networking
- A habit-forming tool
- A product optimized for retention
- A system that improves with repeat use
- A place that promises healing, growth, or clarity

Any feature that implies progress, improvement, or dependency violates the project’s intent.

---

## 4. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 4.1 Emotional Offloading ≠ Emotional Processing

This project does not seek insight or meaning.
It provides a surface, not a mirror.

The act of writing is the action.
No interpretation follows.

---

### 4.2 Presence Without Surveillance

The system acknowledges the user without watching them.
It witnesses without observing.
It holds space without memory unless explicitly requested.

---

### 4.3 Relief Over Resolution

This is a pause, not a path.
A bench, not a destination.
A moment of lightness, not transformation.

---

## 5. USER EMOTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS

Assume the user:
- has low energy
- has limited attention
- may be emotionally guarded
- may not return
- may leave abruptly
- may be using this in a liminal or private moment (late night, transit, between tasks)

Design for the nervous system first, cognition second.

---

## 6. EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES

The experience must:
- Never rush the user
- Never demand completion
- Never reward engagement
- Never imply urgency
- Never escalate emotion
- Never require learning
- Never punish leaving

The experience must feel emotionally reversible at all times.

---

## 7. USER JOURNEY (MANDATORY FLOW)

### 7.1 Arrival
- Minimal visual noise
- Warm, paper-like background (never pure white)
- No branding, icons, or illustrations
- One gentle sentence acknowledging emotional weight
- One entry point

Tone: welcoming, not inviting.

---

### 7.2 Writing Space
- Single expanding text field
- Cursor blinking on load
- No character limits
- No spellcheck or grammar correction
- No AI suggestions
- No auto-analysis
- No visible system response while typing

Writing must feel uninterrupted and unobserved.

---

### 7.3 Post-Writing Pause
- Interface responds to stillness, not submission
- Subtle animation (breathing space, slight opacity shift)
- Acknowledgement of trust without interpretation

---

### 7.4 The Three Choices (Equal Weight)

#### A. Let it go
- Thought disappears gently
- No drama
- No finality language
- Ends with calm closure

#### B. Let someone else carry it for a moment
- Completely anonymous
- No replies
- No metrics
- Shows only one short human sentence from another user
- No scrolling

#### C. Save it for later
- Private, unguessable link
- No account
- No reminders
- Explicit permission to never return

---

### 7.5 Exit
- Clean visual space
- One closing sentence
- No CTA
- No encouragement to share
- No “come back”

---

## 8. LANGUAGE SYSTEM (STRICT RULES)

### Always:
- Use second person (“you”)
- Use short sentences
- Use plain, concrete language
- Allow imperfection
- Sound written, not generated

### Never:
- Use exclamation points
- Use emojis
- Use clinical or diagnostic language
- Use inspirational or motivational language
- Use metaphors
- Use reassurance promises (“everything will be okay”)

Language should feel like a carefully written note, not an interface.

---

## 9. VISUAL & INTERACTION DESIGN RULES

- Fonts must feel human, literary, and calm
- Avoid anything “techy,” “startup-like,” or playful
- Color palette limited to 2–3 desaturated tones
- Motion must be slow, predictable, and optional
- Respect reduced-motion preferences
- Avoid sharp contrast and sudden transitions

The nervous system must feel safe.

---

## 10. AI USAGE (INVISIBLE AND RESTRICTED)

AI may be used ONLY to:
- Help the creator generate gentle language variations
- Assist with safety filtering and moderation
- Balance tone across anonymous shared content

AI must NEVER:
- Speak directly to the user
- Interpret or analyze user input
- Summarize thoughts
- Offer advice
- Claim understanding
- Personalize responses

The user must never feel processed.

---

## 11. ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

### 11.1 Scope & Non-Claims
The project makes no claims about healing, improvement, or care.

Under-claiming is an ethical stance.

---

### 11.2 Dependency & Avoidance
The experience actively resists dependency through:
- No accounts
- No reminders
- No personalization
- No progress indicators
- No incentives to return

---

### 11.3 Crisis Boundaries
This is not positioned as crisis support.
The design avoids escalation, deep disclosure prompts, or framing as help.

---

### 11.4 Power & Restraint
Listening systems hold power.
This project limits that power by refusing interpretation, memory, and optimization.

Restraint is the safety mechanism.

---

## 12. ACCESSIBILITY PRINCIPLES

### Cognitive Accessibility
- Low reading load
- No instructions to remember
- No multi-step processes
- No time pressure

### Emotional Accessibility
- No judgment
- No emotional escalation
- No forced reflection

### Technical Accessibility
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High legibility typography
- Reduced-motion support

Accessibility decisions may reduce visual flair or complexity. This is intentional.

---

## 13. PRIVACY & CONSENT MODEL

### Privacy Principles
- Minimal data collection
- No behavioral profiling
- No cross-session identity
- No third-party trackers

The safest data is data that never exists.

---

### Consent
- Writing is ephemeral by default
- Saving requires explicit user action
- Leaving the page ends participation immediately

Consent is continuous and revocable.

---

## 14. PORTFOLIO PRESENTATION PRINCIPLES

The project must be presented in two parallel modes:
1. For people who need the experience
2. For people evaluating the work

These must be separated.

The experience itself should never explain or justify itself.
All explanation belongs outside the experience.

---

## 15. SUCCESS CRITERIA

The project is successful if:
- A user feels relief even if they leave mid-way
- A user feels no pressure to return
- A user feels respected, not engaged
- A user feels less burden without being told they are

If the experience feels impressive, clever, optimized, or persuasive — it has failed.

---

## 16. FINAL GUIDING PRINCIPLE

This project should feel like someone quietly holding the door open,
not inviting the user inside.

Design, write, and build accordingly.
